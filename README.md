This is the little Windows 10 tool for more comfort chooses with what gpu run an app, the integrated power save gpu or discreted high perfomance one.

It first attempt to build mvvm app.

## !!!WARNING!!!

* Before use this app backup at least HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DirectX\UserGpuPreferences for your user!
* At this point app has bad ui/ux, if you click Delete button, choosen keys will delete from registry without any message;
* If something goes wrong, the app will close without warning because I didn't use catch-try-excepts.

## First release

Yeah, baby, it's first version with full functional.

There a lot of job for this app: refactoring, catch exceptions, ui/ux improve, bugs fix.

But i don't want raise C# skill now, so this version enough for me, but i don't recommend to use it, except for learning purposes (the perfect code to show of what not to do)
